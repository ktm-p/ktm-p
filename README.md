## Hi, I'm Michael!

I'm currently a Junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Pure Mathematics. I am mostly interested in Algebra, Algorithm Theory, Complexity Theory, and Cryptography. I also dabble a bit in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, I guess.

You can find my website containing more information about myself at https://www.ktm-p.net/.
